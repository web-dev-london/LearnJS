/* Chapter Recap
Lodash is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with collections (arrays of objects), objects, strings, etc.
To debounce a function is to make it wait a certain amount of time before running again.
How to import debounce: import {debounce} from "lodash-es";
Basic usage of debounce: debounce(callback, waitMilliseconds)
date-fns is a collection of functions that make it easier to work with dates in JavaScript.
You can import functions from the main package as follows: import {format, addYears} from "date-fns";
The addYears(date, numberOfYears) function can be used to increase an existing date object with a number of years.
You can create a new JavaScript date object with new Date().
Whenever you import a file in your JavaScript code, the import will happen synchronously. This is called a static import.
You can dynamically import a file or a library by using import() as a function.
import() returns a promise. It resolves with an object containing the exported data.
default exports are available under the default key and other data is available as keys under the same name they were exported with.
